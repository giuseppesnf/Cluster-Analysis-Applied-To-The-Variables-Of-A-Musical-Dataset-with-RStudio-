Cluster analysis applied to the variables of a musical dataset with RStudio


Through the use of the integrated development environment (IDE) RStudio, with this work I examined a dataset concerning the musical field (using Spotify as the main source): in particular, using the properties of the R programming language, a cluster analysis was carried out, also exploiting Principal Component Analysis (PCA), with the aim of experimenting a multivariate statistical analysis on a dataset containing a large number of observations. The project has tried to trace back heterogeneous elements into several subsets that tend to be homogeneous and mutually exhaustive, also applying graphic representations capable of showing the classification performed in a simple way.
